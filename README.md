# Android Summer Practice 2022

## Development process

**main** would be our start branch.

### Branch creation
Before start working on your issue, you have to create another branch from **main** with the issue name using the following format: 
```feature/task-name#taskId```

Example: 
- Issue: ```#1 Create Splash Screen```
- branch name: ```feature/create-splash-screen#1```

### Commit message
For each commit message you have to add first the Issue name then what is included in the commit changes.

Example: 
- Issue: ```#1 Create Splash Screen```
- commit message: ```#1 Create Splash Screen: Add ability to display the splash screen for 2 seconds.```

### Pull Request
When a first commit is pushed, you have to create a Pull Request from your current branch to the main branch.

If the task is not finished yet, add the [WIP] tag before the Pull Request title.

Example: 
- Issue: ```#1 Create Splash Screen```
- Pull request title: ```[WIP] #1 Create Splash Screen```

When the task is finished, you have to remove the [WIP] tag and assign the reviewer to **pmiclynx**.
